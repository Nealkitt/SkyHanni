_Frequently Asked Questions_

> **1: How do I open the SkyHanni Menu?**
> Use the command `/sh`.

> **2: How can I resize the GUI?**
> Do `/sh gui` to open the position editor. Then hover over an element and scroll your mouse wheel to change the size of a single GUI element.
> Do `/sh scale` to change the global GUI scale of all elements at once.

> **3: My Garden Crop Milestones are not accurate. What should I do?**
> To sync your Crop Milestones with SkyHanni, open `/cropmilestones` once.

> **4: How can I move GUIs like Coins/Copper in SkyMart?**
> Use the command `/sh open hotkey` to set a hotkey, and press it inside the GUI you want to move.

> **5: My Jacob Contest Display crops are wrong, how do I fix this?**
> Run the command `/shclearcontestdata` to clear the Jacob contest data.

> **6: Why does my Item Tracker feature not track this item?**
> 1. Check if the item goes directly into your sacks.
> 2. If it does, enable the sack pickup chat message from Hypixel:
     >   - Go to `Hypixel Settings -> Personal -> Chat Feedback` and enable `Sack Notifications`.
> 3. If you want the [Sacks] messages to be hidden, do `/sh sacks hider` and enable that.

> **7: How do I remove SkyHanni GUI elements?**
> 1. Type `/sh gui`.
> 2. Click the UI element (if the UI element is not shown, follow FaQ #5).
> 3. Disable this feature.

> **8: How do I reset a SkyHanni tracker?**
> 1. Do you want to **view only the current session**?
     >   - Open the inventory (Press E) and hover over the display.
>   - Then click on `[This Session]`.
> 2. Do you want to **reset the current session**?
     >   - Open the inventory (Press E) and hover over the display.
>   - Then click on `Reset Session!`.
> 3. (**For Diana Trackers only**) Do you want to **view only the current mayor**?
     >   - Open the inventory (Press E) and hover over the display.
>   - Then click on `[This Mayor]`.
> 4. Do you want to **remove one specific item** from the tracker?
     >   - Open the inventory (Press E) and hover over the display.
>   - Then shift-click on an item in the list to remove it.
> 5. Do you want to reset the total stats of a tracker?
     >   - To reset a tracker, use the in-game command `/shcommands <tracker type>`.
>   - Execute the obtained command to reset the tracker.

> **9: Why can I still see the normal Scoreboard when using Custom Scoreboard?**
> Most of the time, this is a mod conflict, check if any additional mods installed change the scoreboard in any way, then disable those.
> If there's no mods modifying the scoreboard, make sure the option to "Hide Vanilla Scoreboard" is actually enabled.

> **10: Why doesn't the burrow warp key and line prioritize my guess waypoint when there are known burrows nearby?**
> This is intended behavior. SkyHanni prioritizes the closest known burrow or guess waypoint, not necessarily the guess waypoint itself. Focusing on the closest point, even if it's a known burrow and not your guess, is faster and leads to a higher "burrows dug over time" rate, meaning more mobs, more rare mobs, more money and faster milestones.
> While interrupting your current chain to focus on a nearby burrow might feel counterintuitive, it ultimately benefits you in the long run.
> The existing chain isn't reset, and you gain the advantage of a higher burrow digging rate.

> **10: Why is my tab list showing twice/overlapping?**
> This is a mod conflict with Skyblocker "fancy tab HUD" and SkyHanni "Compact Tab List", disable the one you dislike.
